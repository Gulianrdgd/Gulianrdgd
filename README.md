### Hi, I'm Julian van der HorstðŸ‘‹
I am a senior full-stack software engineer and with my background in cybersecurity, I now focus on writing privacy-friendly and secure software.

Before I did the right thing, I did the fun thing. During covid I made all sorts of websites that me and my friends used to have some fun online.
